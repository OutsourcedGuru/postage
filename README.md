Windows 7 C# program to show weight plus calculated postage and stamp count required

Stamps.com has a promotion which includes a free USB-based/powered scale but comes tied with a subscription/membership program which is likely too expensive.  It's not unusual then to see these scales on the desks of people and they can't calculate postage since they dropped the monthly program due to the cost.

This Windows application will return that functionality without incurring any cost.  It's a simple, Windows form app which displays the weight, calculated postage and indicates the number of stamps of each type minimally required by the US Postal Service for 1st Class envelopes.  It will additionally determine the rate for envelopes which are likely FLATS (larger envelopes) even though it can't technically see what type of envelope size was dropped onto the scale.  For this reason, it's important to note that an oversized large envelope less than 3.5 ounces can't be accurately calculated for postage; in this case you'd note the weight and manually make your own determination.  I have included the rate calculations as text on the display, however.
